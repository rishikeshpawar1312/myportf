        I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a keen eye for creating elegant solutions 
        to complex problems. With expertise in modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, 
        and Node.js, I focus on building scalable and user-friendly applications. When I'm not 
        coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, 
        and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
